# Epson QX-11 Research Archive

This repository documents the technical details, discoveries, ROM dumps, schematics, and experimental work related to the **Epson QX-11** computer, also known in Japan as the **QC-11** and in Latin America (Venezuela) as the **Abacus**.

The QX-11 is a little-known MS-DOS-compatible system produced by Epson in the early 1980s, featuring a unique architecture, proprietary video and floppy systems, and a ROM cartridge slot used primarily for kanji fonts or application software.
